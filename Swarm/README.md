# Swarm
This example shows you how to use Ethereum swarm.  

## Prerequisites
You'll need a fully running Geth node.  I recommend a private version of geth with easy mining difficulty.
You'll need a Swarm service running on localhost.

## WARNINGS
* Swarm is in alpha, and is not production ready software.
* A private Ethereum chain with fast mining can fill a disk quickly.  Watch your VM consumption!
* This code is sample only!  Do not deploy to production!
